    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ah, the illustrious blackened chicken—a dish so profoundly flavored and gloriously seasoned that it practically dances on your taste buds. But, you see, its origins are as delightfully quirky as the dish itself, thanks to my great-great-great-great grandmother Colleen. Let me take you on a journey through time, spice, and a rather curious tale.</p>
    <p>Colleen O'Malley, born in the early 19th century in the foggy heart of Ireland, was a woman of unique talents and even more unique interests. You see, she wasn't just a cook; she was a master of eccentric hobbies. On weekends, she was known to race ducks through her garden, compete in competitive sheep-shearing events, and hold tea parties where the guests had to wear their fanciest hats while reciting limericks.</p>
    <p>Her claim to fame, however, was her culinary experimentation, particularly her ambitious attempts to fuse Irish cooking with the fiery spices of the Caribbean. Legend has it that one fateful day, while grappling with a particularly obstinate pot roast, Colleen decided to turn her hand to chicken. After all, the roast had stubbornly refused to be anything other than bland and blandness was simply unacceptable in Colleen's kitchen.</p>
    <p>Armed with a bag of mysterious spices she had acquired from a traveling spice merchant (who, incidentally, had a pet parrot named Sir Squawks-a-Lot), Colleen set about creating what she called “Chicken of the Isles and Beyond.” She mixed paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and other exotic spices into a blend so potent it could probably make a dragon sweat. After liberally coating her chicken, she slapped it onto a skillet so hot it seemed to steam with indignation.</p>
    <p>Colleen's blackened chicken, as the dish came to be known, emerged from the pan with a glorious crust—a deep, smoky blackness that was as surprising as it was delicious. Her family was initially skeptical, but one bite and they were hooked. The dish became the centerpiece of every family gathering, so much so that her descendants have been passing it down through generations, each adding their own little twists but always honoring Colleen's original flair.</p>
    <p>So there you have it. The blackened chicken you savor today has a history rich with spice, adventure, and a touch of the absurd. It was born from a blend of Irish tenacity and Caribbean zest, cooked by a woman whose culinary passions were matched only by her penchant for whimsical pursuits. Whenever you take a bite of that crispy, flavorful masterpiece, remember that it all started with Colleen O'Malley and her delightful penchant for turning the mundane into the extraordinary.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt    </li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet until it's hot.</li>
        <li>Mix paprika, cayenne, cumin, thyme, onion powder, white pepper, and salt together in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Spray chicken breasts on both sides with cooking spray, then coat evenly with spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the hot pan and cook for 1 minute. Turn, and cook 1 minute on other side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F</li>
