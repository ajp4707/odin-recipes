    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Back in the olden days, my great-great-great-great grandmother Colleen used to make this dish for me. She lived a hard life - she was born with no hands, feet, and only half of her prefrontal cortex. She was born poor and neglected. Neither of her parents showed up to her own birth. When she was one year old, her father enlisted her in the army as a crawlspace baby. Her job was to climb through the vents where the adult soldiers couldn't fit and catch the rats who were eating the soldiers' rations with her teeth.</p>
    <p>She turned this hardship into triumph - to this day, she was/is the army's finest ratcatcher. When she was two years old, she invented the world's first and finest rat jambalaya. Since then, the recipe has been iterated over incessantly because my great-great-great-great gram is a perfectionist. Today, the recipe has less rats, less baby formula, and more chicken broth. I hope you'll enjoy this meal served over rice even more than I do!</p>
